# Factor Of Control

> **Disclaimer:** This prototype only contains two empirical and exaggerated questions with random aspects of DISC* capabilities; the real test is more extensive and more accurate in answers weights. This project aims to show the power of DISC capabilities in reducing the time to select and classify possible candidates for a job offer, reducing time, avoiding unnecessary in-person or phone interviews and choosing the right person with the proper behaviour at a specific position. As a result the company reduce the turn over.

People are hired chiefly based on their professional skills but fired based on their behaviour.

Questions like What motivated you to apply to this company?, Describe two accomplishments you were proud of in your last role?, How have you overcome conflicts when working with a challenging team member? Why did you leave your last job? What are your strengths and weaknesses? What are your values and what do you want to do in the future? Where did you see you in five years?

All these questions in the actual interviews scenarios will generate a positive or a negative impression for each candidate based on the feeling of the interviewer perspective (sometimes stressed, overloaded, high pace, tight deadlines etc). With the help of the DISC algorithm you will be precise saying something like this candidate has a 82.56% match with the job behaviour expectations.
